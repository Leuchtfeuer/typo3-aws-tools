About Amazon CloudFront
=======================

Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to
customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment. CloudFront is integrated
with AWS ‚Äì both physical locations that are directly connected to the AWS global infrastructure, as well as other AWS services.
CloudFront works seamlessly with services including AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation, Amazon S3, Elastic Load Balancing or Amazon
EC2 as origins for your applications, and Lambda@Edge to run custom code closer to customers‚Äô users and to customize the user
experience. Lastly, if you use AWS origins such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing, you don‚Äôt pay for any data
transferred between these services and CloudFront.
