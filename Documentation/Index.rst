This extension connects your TYPO3 instance to `Amazon CloudFront <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/>`__. It rewrites all file
paths in the frontend to match your CDN domain. You also have the possibility (at several places) to invalidate Amazon CloudFront
entries.

To figure out which extension version is supported by your TYPO3 instance, take a quick look at our
:ref:`version matrix <about-compatibility>`.
